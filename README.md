# glfw.zig

This is a fork of [hexops/glfw][1] which is itself a fork of [glfw/glfw][2].

## Why this forkception ?

The intention under this fork is the same as [hexops][13] had when they forked [glfw/glfw][2]: package it for [Zig][3]. So:
* Unnecessary files have been deleted,
* The build system has been replaced with `build.zig`.

However this repository has subtle differences for maintainability tasks:
* No shell scripting,
* A cron runs every day to check [glfw/glfw][2]. Then it updates this repository if a new release is available,
* No support for macOS.

## How to use it

The goal of this repository is not to provide a [Zig][3] binding for [glfw/glfw][2]. There are at least as many legit ways as possible to make a binding as there are active accounts on Github. So you are not going to find an answer for this question here. The point of this repository is to abstract the [glfw/glfw][2] compilation process with [Zig][3] (which is not new comers friendly and not easy to maintain) to let you focus on your application. So you can use **glfw.zig**:
- as raw (see GLFW examples [here](https://github.com/tiawl/cimgui.zig/blob/trunk/examples)),
- as a daily updated interface for your [Zig][3] binding of [glfw/glfw][2] (see [here][14] for a private usage).

## Important note

The current usage of this repository is centered around [tiawl/cimgui.zig][3] compilation. So for your usage it could break because some files have been filtered in the process. If it happens, open an issue: this repository is open to potential usage evolution.

## Dependencies

The [Zig][3] part of this package is relying on the latest [Zig][3] release (0.13.0) and will only be updated for the next one (so for the 0.14.0).

Here the repositories' version used by this fork:
* [glfw/glfw](https://github.com/tiawl/glfw.zig/blob/trunk/.references/glfw)
